# First Node JS

This project was a practice exercise completed during the QUB MSc in Software Development,
specifically this exercise followed the lecture on Node JS

During the exercise a basic Node web server was created, which listens for responses on port 3000 and responds with HTML markup.
If an invalid url is given, appropriate headers (404) are sent along with a H1 Heading "Page not found".
